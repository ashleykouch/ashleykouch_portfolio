## Requirements / Purpose

### MVP

Portfolio will include the following sections:

- A landing page/section with name and title.
- An about page/section with a little information about myself.
- A tech stacks/skills page/section with all the techs learned.
- A project page/section with all lastest projects and projects wanting be showcased.
- A contact page/section with email, GitHub profile link, LinkedIn profile link and others if needed.

### Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills, experiences and other projects through visual and technical pathways.

### Tech Stacks Used

HTML: As HTML is the primary language used to create the structure and content of webpages (and is essentially the backbone of the web). Using HTML allows you to define the structure of the portfolio, including headings, paragraphs, images and links.

CSS: In order to make the portfolio visually appealing, CSS wwas used to style and customise the HTML content. Using CSS allows you to change the colors, fonts, and layout of the portfolio to make it visually appealing and unique.

Bootstrap: As a powerful front-end framework, Bootstrap includes pre-built HTML, CSS and JavaScript components that can be used to create responsive and mobile-friendly webpages.

## Build Steps

There are no installations or requirements to run the portfolio. As the portfolio has been deployed, it can be accessed straight through the hosting link.

However, if the portfolio is downloaded, simply open the 'index.html' file in any preferred web browser to view.

## Design Goals / Approach

The goal was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly personal portfolio website that effectively showcased my skills, achievements and personality, while also being easy to navigate and accessible to a diverse audience.

It was implemented in a way that could showcase my personal brand or aesthetic preferences as well as incorporate desired functionalities and features.

## Features

- Responsive design: Ensuring that the portfolio is optimised for different screen sizes and devices, so viewers can easily access and navigate the website on desktop and mobile devices.
- Navigation bar: The navigation menu on the left side of the portfolio allows viewers to quickly access different sections of the website.
- Clean and modern design: Keeping the design and colour palette minimal makes the website visually appealing whilst the professional design reflects personal brand and style.
- Personalisation: The use of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap allows the portoflio to be unique. It allows experimentation with different colors, fonts, and design elements to reflect personality and style.

## Known issues

- LinkedIn link in footer not working when embedded into HTML

---

## Future Goals

As of now, the portfolio is up to the standard in which I want it to be. It is noted that the portfolio will be continuously updated to reflect recent projects and personal changes. Furthermore, if possible, I would add in more animation provide a better user experience.

---

## What did you struggle with?

- Responsiveness of the website: It was my first time using Bootstrap so it took a while for me to understand the concepts and make the website responsive.

## Further details, related projects, reimplementations

This project is a reimplementation of a portfolio project I had completed during the \_nology course. It was made with HTML and CSS. I had decided to recreate the project towards the end of the course to showcase a development in skills and understanding of code.
